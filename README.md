# TDPM-DIP

This repo contains the implementation for [Truncated Diffusion Probabilistic Models with Deep Image Prior framework](report.pdf)

TDPM-DIP is a framework that improves the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) with Deep Image Prior (DIP) as an implicit generator $G_\psi$. TDPM-DIP works on a truncated diffusion chain which has shorter length than DDPM, and the implicit distribution at $T_{trunc}$ will be generated by DIP in order to approximate with the distribution generated by the noise scheduler. An illustrative about TDPM-DIP framework are shown in the figure below:
